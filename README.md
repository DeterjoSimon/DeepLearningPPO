# DeepLearningPPO
PPO implementation for a project in the course Deep Learning (02456). This implementation runs through the IMPALA framework and tries to learn to play the game "Starpilot" offered by the Procgen Benchmark in order to evaluate the generalization capability of an agent linked to Reinforcement Learning.
